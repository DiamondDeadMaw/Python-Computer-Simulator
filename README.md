# Python Computer Simulator
 A fully programmable computer in Python

Features an RISC 16 bit CPU based on the Harvard architecture, 16K RAM (2^14 16-bit words), 32K of read-only 
instruction memory (2^15 16-bit words), a 512x256 screen with its own dedicated memory, and keyboard input.

Also includes a GUI (rendered using the pygame library) to see memory locations change in real time, the current instruction, the program counter, the screen, and to set the speed of the CPU.
Use the included assembler to write your own programs and execute them.

Uses the Nand2Tetris Assembly language, with a few additions.
